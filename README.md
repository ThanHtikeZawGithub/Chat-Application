#Chat Application

This is the simple chat application using web-socket and full-stack MERN with tailwindCSS.
User information (username,password) are stored using MongoDb since this is lite version and don't have much security case.
You don't need to add friend or send request instead you will see all the people using this application (online or not). 


1.You can register with your username and password.(You should set your name as you want to show other since username will be display as your name)
2.Start chatting with the people who are already using this app.

I'll be updating UI in the future because this version is mainly focused on backend.
Definitely there will be a lot of bugs. So please bear with me.

Enjoyy!!
